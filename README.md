# EDMG Studio Monolith Repo

This repository is the single authoritative source tree for EDMG Studio.

Studio is not a sidecar anymore. The desktop shell, React frontend, FastAPI
backend, vendored EDMG engine packages, setup flow, release packaging, and
support tooling all converge on one product path:

- `studio/edmg-studio/`

The older standalone-engine installers, duplicate Electron shell, and extra
README entrypoints have been retired so the repo presents one product instead
of multiple competing workflows.

The legacy standalone web UI prototypes have also been retired. Their planning
and audio-reactive capabilities now live inside the Studio app workbenches:

- `studio/edmg-studio/src/workbenches/AiNlpWorkbench.tsx`
- `studio/edmg-studio/src/workbenches/AudioReactiveWorkbench.tsx`

## Canonical launch

Windows:

```bat
RUN_ME.bat
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
./run_me.sh
```

Those launchers open the Studio dev launcher in `studio/edmg-studio/tools/launcher_gui.py`, which
keeps the UI, backend, and `Studio Home` storage aligned with the same settings
used by the packaged app.

## Canonical product layout

- `studio/edmg-studio/`
  Electron shell, preload, main-process runtime, React/Vite frontend, packaging
  scripts, release validation, and the only Node/pnpm package root in the repo.
- `studio/edmg-studio/python_backend/`
  FastAPI backend plus the vendored `enhanced_deforum_music_generator` and
  `deforum_music` engine packages that power planning, analysis, schedules, and
  EDMG Core support.
- `studio/edmg-studio/tools/launcher_gui.py`
  Shared dev launcher and Studio Home bootstrap flow.
- `studio/edmg-studio/packaging/windows/`
  Windows-first release orchestration for the packaged Studio app.

## Studio Home

Studio separates the app install directory from the heavy runtime storage root.
The `Studio Home` contains:

- `data`
- `models`
- `cache`
- `logs`
- `external`
- `electron`

That keeps large downloads, render caches, and external tools off the app
install path and allows migration to another drive or mount such as `D:\` on
Windows or `/mnt/media/EDMG-Studio` on Linux.

## JS Tooling

- Run all JS/Electron commands from `studio/edmg-studio/`.
- Use Node.js `20.19+` or `22.12+`; Node 22 LTS is pinned in `studio/edmg-studio/.node-version`.
- The canonical package manager is `pnpm@10.33.0`, pinned in `studio/edmg-studio/package.json`.
- The shipped desktop app version also comes from `studio/edmg-studio/package.json#version`.

## Test strategy

- Repo-level tests live under `tests/` and run from the repo root with `python -m pytest`.
- Backend package tests live under `studio/edmg-studio/python_backend/` and run from that directory with `python -m pytest`.
- To run both scopes in sequence from the repo root, use `python scripts/run_pytest_scopes.py`.
- The root `pytest.ini` intentionally excludes the backend-local pytest scope so `python -m pytest` from the repo root stays a repo-level command.

## Recommended Local Stack

- Planner default: NVIDIA Nemotron Ultra via `nemotron_cloud` (NIM)
- Local Ollama planner: `nemotron-3-ultra:cloud` or low-resource `qwen3:4b`
- OpenAI-compatible default model: `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-ultra-253b-v1`
- Broad still-image default: SDXL Base 1.0
- Fast still-image option: SD3.5 Large Turbo
- Reference still guidance: SD3.5 ControlNet Blur, Canny, and Depth
- Primary HF video backend: Wan2.2 TI2V 5B
- Short image-to-video fallback: SVD XT Img2Vid

## Hardware Tiers

- Low-spec: `qwen3:4b` (Ollama) + SDXL Base 1.0
- Mid-range: Nemotron cloud or `qwen3:8b` + SDXL Base 1.0 + SD3.5 Large Turbo + SD3.5 Blur/Canny
- High-end: Nemotron cloud + SDXL Base 1.0 + SD3.5 Large Turbo + SD3.5 Blur/Canny/Depth + Wan2.2 TI2V 5B

## Compatibility shims

- Repo-root `sitecustomize.py` and the repo-root `librosa/` package are source-tree compatibility shims for development and tests.
- Packaged/backend install flows rely on the declared Python dependencies and do not package those repo-root shims.

## Unreal bridge status

- Studio-side bridge: usable. The repo can preview, export, build an Unreal import plan, and import returned renders back into canonical project outputs.
- Unreal-side runtime integration: partial. There is no verified in-editor smoke test on this machine, no packaged Unreal plugin/module, no live OSC/WebSocket/Remote Control execution path, no one-click Unreal render job launcher, and no deeper Sequencer build beyond the first importer pass.

## Compatibility note

The repo root now keeps only thin launch aliases and monolith-level docs. The
runtime code, packaging logic, backend engine packages, and operator tooling
live under `studio/edmg-studio/`.
